/** # Write a method, coprime(num_1, num_2), that accepts two numbers as args.
# The method should return true if the only common divisor between the two numbers is 1.
# The method should return false otherwise. For example coprime(25, 12) is true because
# 1 is the only number that divides both 25 and 12. **/
